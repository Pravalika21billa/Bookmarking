    <p>My name often poses difficulties for Americans.

        Pronunciation: in Dutch, the "G" in Guido is a hard G, pronounced roughly like the "ch" in Scottish "loch". (Listen to the sound clip.) However, if you're American, you may also pronounce it as the Italian "Guido". I'm not too worried about the associations with mob assassins that some people have. :-)
        
        Spelling: my last name is two words, and I'd like to keep it that way, the spelling on some of my credit cards notwithstanding. Dutch spelling rules dictate that when used in combination with my first name, "van" is not capitalized: "Guido van Rossum". But when my last name is used alone to refer to me, it is capitalized, for example: "As usual, Van Rossum was right."
        
        Alphabetization: in America, I show up in the alphabet under "V". But in Europe, I show up under "R". And some of my friends put me under "G" in their address book...

        <p>Guido van Rossum is a Dutch computer programmer best known as the creator of the Python programming language. Born on January 31, 1956, in the Netherlands, Van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s and released the first version of the language in 1991. His goal was to create a language that was easy to learn, efficient, and versatile. Python quickly gained popularity due to its simplicity, readability, and large standard library. Van Rossum's work on Python has had a significant impact on the programming community, and he is widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in the field of computer science. He has received numerous awards for his contributions to the field, including the ACM Software System Award.</p>
